## Third Party Packages and Libraries

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - Used for the majority of our styling. This was a good move from the start since it greatly speeds up the time it takes to develop and design clean UI without messing with custom CSS.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
  - Used as our main database to hold all user-centric information including:
    - First/last names
    - Usernames
    - Emails
    - Passwords
    - urls to Profile Pictures
    - urls to Post Pictures
    - Posts attached to users
        - Comments
        - Likes
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
  - Used as our secondary database to hold all the physical images including:
    - Profile Pictures
    - Post Pictures
    - Default profile pictures come from [here](https://boringavatars.com).
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
  - Used as our account verification and password reset medium by sending the users emails.

## In Progress

We decided to push some features to the end/abandon because we would rather serve a polished UI/UX rather than buggy code and broken features with lacking UI/UX. For instance:
- we had a `pagination` fetch in the beginning but it was interfering with our deleting and liking so we ended up disabling it for now until we figure out an elegant solution to the problem.
